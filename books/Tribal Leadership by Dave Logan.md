“Stage Two use language centered on “my life sucks”. People in this cultural stage are passively antagonistic; they cross their arms in judgment yet never really get interested enough to spark any passion. Their laughter is quietly sarcastic and resigned. The Stage Two talk is that they’ve seen it all before and watched it all fail.”
 “You literally cannot make this journey alone—your tribe will either help you or prevent your forward movement. In fact, you can move forward only by bringing others with you."

“Most formal education, by design, keeps people at Stage Three all the way through graduate school, with each course showing them what they don’t know (often bumping them back to Stage Two for a time), imparting knowledge, and allowing them to prove they have learned it through exams and papers.”

“When people take their first job, they talk about their achievements but also miss their friends”

“The key is that they accept this obstacle as the way it is and the way it always will
be."

“my life sucks” seems immune to getting rid of the subject of their complaints—if managers fix what they snarl about, they go out and get more reasons to be unhappy. People in our studies did complain about “idiot bosses” but also about the name of the company (it took too long to type out on e-mails), the temperature at 72 degrees ( just too hot), the printer took “forever” (actually, ten seconds) from the time they hit control-P until they had hard copy.”

“Does the job require [Stage Three]?’” Coaching people to drop behavior that is required by the system is harmful to everyone. “If he’s doing what the job requires,” Beck added, “don’t bother him.” The question to ask is, would you be more successful in Stage Three or Stage Four?”

“Awareness comes first, and it has always been this way”

“When [people] operate in the ‘I’ system, they can’t have a legacy.”
