Good Economics for Hard Times

О прибыли местных жителей и иммигрантах:
“...Card found no difference, either immediately after the immigrants arrived or some years later; the wages of natives were not affected by the arrival of the Marielitos ... The supply-demand model might not directly apply to immigration.... In all of these cases, the researchers found very little adverse impact on the local population”

“Indeed, branding and distribution costs are often much larger than manufacturing costs. For many items, the cost of production is no more than 10–15 percent of the retail cost. This means a more efficient producer can do very little to affect the final price of the product in proportional terms. Cutting his cost of production by 50 percent would only reduce the overall cost of putting the product in the hands of the buyer by at most 7.5 percent......That could still be a significant amount of money, but as a large literature has demonstrated, proportional changes are what buyers seem to care about. In a classic experiment, one group was asked whether they would drive twenty minutes to save $5 on a $15 calculator and another group whether they would do the same for a $125 calculator. Twenty minutes is twenty minutes, and $5 is $5, but the answers were very different: “68 percent of the respondents were willing to make an extra trip to save $5 on a $15 calculator; only 29 percent were willing to exert the same effort when the price of the calculator was $125.” The point is that $5 is a third of $15 but only 4 percent of $125, which is why they switch in one case but not the other. Consumers are unlikely to switch sellers to save 7.5 percent.”
