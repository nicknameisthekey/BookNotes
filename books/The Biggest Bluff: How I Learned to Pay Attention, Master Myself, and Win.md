What I found was something completely unexpected. Over and over,
people would overestimate the degree of control they had over events—
smart people, people who excelled at many things, people who should have
known better. Not only would they decide ahead of time how they were
going to divide their investments, but they would decide based on
incredibly limited information which stock was “good” and stick to their
guns—even as they started losing money. The more they overestimated
their own skill relative to luck, the less they learned from what the
environment was trying to tell them, and the worse their decisions became:
the participants grew increasingly less likely to switch to winning stocks,
instead doubling down on losers or gravitating entirely toward bonds.
Because they thought they knew more than they did, they ignored any signs
to the contrary—especially when, as inevitably happens in real stock
markets, winners became losers and vice versa. In other words, the illusion
of control is what prevented real control over the game from emerging—
and before long, the quality of people’s decisions deteriorated. They did
what worked in the past, or what they had decided would work—and failed
to grasp that the circumstances had shifted so that a previously successful
strategy was no longer so.

If we lose early, we have a shot at objectivity. But when we win at the
start, that’s when we see the illusion of control playing out in full swing.

It may seem a small deal, but the words we select the ones we filter
out and the ones we eventually choose to put forward are a mirror to our
thinking. Clarity of language is clarity of thought and the expression of a
certain sentiment, no matter how innocuous it seems, can change your
learning, your thinking, your mindset, your mood, your whole outlook. The language we use becomes
our mental habits and our mental habits determine how we learn, how we
grow, what we become. It’s not just a question of semantics: telling bad beat
stories matters. Our thinking about luck has real consequences in terms of
our emotional well being, our decisions, and the way we implicitly view the
world and our role in it.

Chance is just chance: it is neither good nor bad nor personal. Without
us to supply meaning, it’s simple noise.
