“For most people, the only constant is change.”

“We are unwilling to take risks that might lead to failure.”

“people who have experienced a failure are likely to report feeling more pain—and to have a lower tolerance for it—than people who experience success.”

“To learn from failure, you must begin by recognising that failure is not typically as bad as you think it will be. Moreover, when you do fail, don’t let the learning opportunity escape by attributing the cause to outside events or denying that the failure even occurred" 

“Today’s society wants to skip the process. I hate that. Do the little things right to reach the big goals.
—Tom Izzo”

“we believe that the outcome is a reflection of our finite ability and thus we judge it as an evaluation of ourselves—so we focus on performance goals rather than learning goals, to our detriment.”

“created the idea of a premortem... “If it’s twelve months from now and I (or we) have failed spectacularly, what happened?”... A premortem may also help you avoid overconfidence and the assumption that your ideas can only succeed. It spurs the learning process before you begin the actual work.”

“(About resting from work) incorporate movement and, if possible, time outside when we break”

“in many cases, the best thing you can do to learn is not to keep working but, rather, to go to bed and tackle the challenge in the morning.”

“blocking out time for various activities is important and helpful, but learning doesn’t necessarily proceed in such a tightly controlled manner. As much as you might like to schedule time for learning and then have the answer at the end of it, you need some slack or downtime for reflection and thinking, because it may take longer than you wish.”

“Busyness by itself doesn’t lead to learning.”

“Frederick Herzberg’s “One More Time: How Do You Motivate”

“we focus on fixing our weaknesses while struggling to identify our strengths. We tend to dwell on the things that go wrong and want to fix them. But that’s because we believe that we need to excel on all dimensions to achieve long-term success. Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, decide what you’ll focus on and what you’ll say no to.”

“Part of what we were doing was modelling good leadership behavior by taking ownership and showing that change was possible.”
